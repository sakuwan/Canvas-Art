# Canvas Art

Extracted portions of the canvas art that is generally to be displayed on my [site](https://wankowan.moe).

## Current works:

### RainbowCurves
* Multiple BÃ©zier curves that have shifting control and end points, that interpolate between two positions
at custom intervals.
* As the name suggests, cycle between hues at a custom frequency to create rainbow strokes
* Simple, but pretty, though the overlapping color eventually leads to some artifacting, and there is no immediate
solution as the concept itself is destructive; it's nothing more than a transparent canvas being painted on without clearing

### Noise
* Similar to simple TV static, just a simple low-fps noise generator for some visual effects.
